# VMF-Info
Practice app to parse and give general info about .VMF files.

* Boost 1.82.0  
* Some `.vmf` files you'd like to have some basic info about

The `include/` folder currently uses symlinks which of course aren't quite going to work for you.  
I'm sure you can replace it with the actual folder.
